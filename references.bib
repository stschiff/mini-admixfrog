  abstract    = "Summary paragraphThe Siberian Altai mountains have been
                 intermittently occupied by both Neandertals and Denisovans,
                 two extinct hominin groups1,2. While they diverged at least
                 390,000 years ago3,4, later contacts lead to gene flow from
                 Neandertals into Denisovans5,6. Using a new population genetic
                 method that is capable of inferring signatures of admixture
                 from highly degraded genetic data, I show that this gene flow
                 was much more widespread than previously thought. While the
                 two earliest Denisovans both have substantial and recent
                 Neandertal ancestry, I find signatures of admixture in all
                 archaic genomes from the Altai, demonstrating that gene flow
                 also occurred from Denisovans into Neandertals. This suggests
                 that a contact zone between Neandertals and Denisovan
                 populations persisted in the Altai region throughout much of
                 the Middle Paleolithic. In contrast, Western Eurasian
                 Neandertals have little to no Denisovan ancestry. As I find no
                 evidence of natural selection against gene flow, this suggests
                 that neutral demographic processes and geographic isolation
                 were likely major drivers of human differentiation.",
